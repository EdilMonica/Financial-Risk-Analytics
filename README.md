Objective:
To build Logistic Regression using Stats Model library using important
variables which will predict the Net worth of the following year of the companies getting
into negative territory.

Description: 
Businesses or companies can fall prey to default if they are not able to
keep up their debt obligations. Defaults will lead to a lower credit rating for the company
which in turn reduces its chances of getting credit in the future and may have to pay
higher interests on existing debts as well as any new obligations. From an investor's
point of view, he would want to invest in a company if it is capable of handling its
financial obligations, can grow quickly, and is able to manage the growth scale.

A balance sheet is a financial statement of a company that provides a snapshot of what
a company owns, owes, and the amount invested by the shareholders. Thus, it is an
important tool that helps evaluate the performance of a business.

Data that is available includes information from the financial statement of the companies
for the previous year (2015). Also, information about the Net worth of the company in
the following year (2016) is provided which can be used to drive the labeled field.

# Final Interpretation on the Model:

From an Investor’s Point of view, Companies having a Total debt
Coefficient >0.81 can be avoided for investing. As it’s likely to get
into negative territory.
Book value of companies lesser than -5.99 can be taken as an Exit Call
as the company is more likely to go into Degrowth phase
